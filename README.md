# Cyclic Voltammetry Simulation

Cyclic Voltammetry Simulation is a Python-based project aimed at simulating cyclic voltammetry experiments. This technique is widely used in electrochemistry to study the redox properties of chemical compounds.

## Features

- Simulates cyclic voltammetry experiments
- User-friendly interface for parameter inputs
- Generates cyclic voltammograms for analysis
- Customizable simulation settings

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the simulation, use the following command:
python simulate.py

You can customize the simulation parameters by editing the config.json file.

Configuration
The config.json file allows you to customize various parameters for the simulation, such as:

scan_rate: The scan rate of the voltammetry experiment
initial_potential: The initial potential
final_potential: The final potential
number_of_cycles: The number of cycles to simulate
Example configuration:
{
  "scan_rate": 100,
  "initial_potential": -0.5,
  "final_potential": 0.5,
  "number_of_cycles": 3
}
